## CA1. Genetic Algorithm for Curve Fitting

This project implements a genetic algorithm to solve the curve fitting problem. The goal is to determine the coefficients of a polynomial equation based on a given set of data points. The genetic algorithm utilizes concepts inspired by nature and natural selection, aiming to evolve a population of potential solutions over generations to find the optimal solution.

## CA2. Reinforcement Learning Project

This repository contains implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms to solve real-world-like problems. The project focuses on analyzing and implementing three algorithms: Iteration Value, Iteration Policy, and Learning-Q in various scenarios.
